# Test Driven Development

Tests build a strong foundation for flexible and scallable applications. They are written to prove if the program responds as expected.

Steps to write tests:
- Write test that'll fail
- Then write the program code
- Then test your program with the failing test to see if it will actually fail.
- Then write correct tests
- Then test your code
- Then write more codes
- Then write more tests

Test driven development eradicates fear of making mistakes while coding. You should also start by writing failing tests before writing correct test. Run the test code as you continue to write your application.
